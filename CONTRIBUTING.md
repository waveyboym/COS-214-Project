# How to contribute to this project

1. If you have not already, create a new branch in this repository(You can name it whatever you like).
2. Clone your branch onto your local machine where you will do development and testing.
3. As you make changes to your clone, you can push and pull to your branch that you created.
4. When you are satisfied that the feature you wanted to add works, all of the code compiles and all of the various tests have passed, create a pull request and you may ask other members to review your pull request and maybe test your new feature on their local machine's then merge your branch to the main branch, or you may just go right ahead and merge to the main branch.
5. If you want to add a new feature again, just sync your current branch that you created with the main branch, make a git pull onto your local machine for your branch and repeat from step 3.
